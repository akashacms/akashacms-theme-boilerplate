AkashaCMS-boilerplate is an [AkashaCMS](http://akashacms.com) theme supporting the HTML5 Boilerplate framework.
The information below is the original README from the Boilerplate distribution.

We currently incorporate Boilerplate v5

The distribution gets lightly modified for use with AkashaCMS.

1. The `css`, `js` and `img` directories get moved from the root directory into the `boilerplate` directory.
2. Remove the `doc` directory and various `.md` files; otherwise they'd find their way into websites.
3. Use the `index.html` file as the basis of `layouts/h5bp_page.html.ejs`
4. Remove `index.html` from the `assets` directory.

The file `layouts/h5bp_page.html.ejs` is meant to be used as a layout page for AkashaCMS pages.
It gets quite a lot of surgery so that the stylesheets and javascript files actually loaded
can be customized by website authors.

This comes from: [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com)

HTML5 Boilerplate is a professional front-end template for building fast,
robust, and adaptable web apps or sites.

This project is the product of many years of iterative development and combined
community knowledge. It does not impose a specific development philosophy or
framework, so you're free to architect your code in the way that you want.
